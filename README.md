# Web-Data-Automation-Testing

This project demonstrates data/web testing automation via Selenium and BeautifulSoup. 

Data integrity is a critical issue in the ear of big data. 

Automating data testing can help improve the accuracy of our data system.

In this project, we use a popular financial website in Taiwan (i.e., www.simmcloud.com) and try to extract the data for testing.

For an abnormal value or unexpected exception, the system will send email to alert specific administrators
